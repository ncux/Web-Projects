        They are both flagships.. The release timing of the Note series being so close to the completely finalized
        Android version update probably means they work on the S series first,
        while working on any patches that need to occur to fix launch issues with the Note.

                Yours is not a T-Mobile variant so you won't get until Samsung pushes the update to the US
                unlocked model. The phone no longer feels like a complete slug while apps are downloading and installing,
                which is nice. I did the downgrade from the beta to Nougat,
                then back to the latest Oreo build. So it wiped for me. The update is only for the 950U and 955U.

                            A few of my friends have told me to make an account for tinder...
                            I will remember this advice and take a picture of my nose. I don't understand people who try hide their appearance on dating sites....
                            Like, isn't the other person going find out how big you are eventually?

                            However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends,
                            leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy”
                            allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or
                            used for advertising.

                            The best ones are the, "What celeb do you look like?" Then some idiot submits their profile and then a

                            All you had to do was give a whole bunch of permissions and shit to this random ass site.

                We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.
                That was the basis that the entire company was built on. This company taps into angry, jaded, and gullible people. The exact type of people most active on political parts
                of Facebook.

                A little self reflection will reveal a lot on it’s own, you just need to be mentally tough in order to
                make an effort to change the self destructive thinking and behavior. This toxic and vitriolic political
                scene is driven by anger and identity politics. If everyone took effort to remove their own insecurities
                and identity from the conversation, we would find ourselves in a much more empathetic and a much less polarized climate.

                Or just delete Facebook. At least we have power over that kind of propoganda.
                Did that. The doodle heads will stay, and FB is slowly turning into a moron soup.
                I read a book called The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker.
                It’s based off the work of Otto Rank. He believed it was all due to our fear of death.
