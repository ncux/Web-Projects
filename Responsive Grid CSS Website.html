                I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain
                than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields
                and sweatshops.

                When I was a kid there was a smell in the kitchen that would
                not go away no matter how many times I cleaned the oven, fridge and sink.

                Download the Backdrops app, and scroll down in the Featured wallpapers til you find it.
                Pretty much all of MKBHD's wallpapers are from Backdrop or the Google Wallpapers app.

            <p>
                For the first few days everything was great. Most people asked the same 4 or 5 questions
                so it was easy to answer and it was fun to play up the gruff blacksmith character.
                Then we hit the first real weekend of the summer, and we are packed.

                I don't think you were wrong, however, one thing to keep in mind is that when you interview,
                every question and answer has to be viewed through the lens of the potential employer.

                My bathroom had a persistent foul smell. We pulled everything out and cleaned everything
                meticulously but all to no avail. Turns out the bathroom fan filter was clogged up.
                Thanks to my Grandpa for telling me about this possibility after suffering for months lol.
